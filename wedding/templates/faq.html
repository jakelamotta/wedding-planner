		<div>The easiset way, travelling from outside of Sweden or Finland, is to fly to Arlanda Airport or Skavsta Airport.
		From Arlanda the best option is to take the bus 801 towards Uppsala (UL, yellow buses). In Uppsala you should transfer to the
		Eckerö line bus which final destination is the port of Grisslehamn. The bus is included in the ferry ticket. The ferry to the Åland Islands
		departs three times a day. At 10am, 3pm and 8pm. The bus from Uppsala departs 2h prior to the corresponding ferry departure.</div>

		<div>Except for the actual wedding there will be other activities for guests arriving early but details regarding

			For the beer enthusiast the Gastropub and brewery <a hred="https://www.stallhagen.com/en/">Stallhagen</a> has a wide variety of Åland brewed beer and good food.

		<div>Finland, as most countries have on and off during the pandemic had different travel restrictions. We don't forsee
		any problem with entering Finland in June. Hopefully the situation is improved when summer comes but
			<a href="https://www.visitaland.com/en/good-to-know/corona/">here</a> you can find updated travel restrictions for Åland. Please
		keep yourself updated and ask us if you have any questions at all. As there will be around 60-80 guests attending the reception
		and some are in risk groups we encourage all guests to get vaccinated. This will also alleviate issues with travelling.</div>
